# 🎲 Guess My Number Game

A simple, nostalgic number guessing game inspired by the paper version I used to play as a child. This project allowed me to explore building a digital version while sharpening my development skills.

## 📝 Description

**Guess My Number** challenges the player to guess a randomly generated secret number within a specified range. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as:
- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Game state management
- Event handling

## 🚀 Features

- Configurable number range
- Interactive user interface
- Immediate feedback on guesses
- Score tracking (optional)
- Clean and minimal design
